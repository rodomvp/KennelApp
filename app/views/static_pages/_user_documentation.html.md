Most tasks can be accomplished from the **Ward View** (figure \ref{ward_view}). 
Several features immediately worth noting are described below.

### Runs

In the ward view, the different types of runs are marked by visual
representations. Runs show and link to the patient within or say VACANT.

## Tasks related to Patient Care

Tasks related to patient care can be accomplished from the Ward View.

### Generating a feeding list

To print the feeding list for a given shift, 
simply click on knife and fork glyphicon on the top left corner. 
The system will automatically generate a
list of every dog's diet, separated by ward (figure \ref{feeding-list}). Dogs
that are currently NPO (Nil per os) will be removed from the feeding
list.
